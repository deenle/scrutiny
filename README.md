# Why This Fork?

This fork exists to keep Scrutiny alive and growing. The original [AnalogJ/scrutiny](https://github.com/AnalogJ/scrutiny) project development slowed significantly in 2024, while community contributions and feature requests continued to grow. This fork picks up where the original left off, merging pending community PRs and adding new features.

Full credit for the original vision and architecture goes to [AnalogJ](https://github.com/AnalogJ). I started this fork as a learning project, so contributions from more experienced developers are greatly appreciated. Full disclosure: I use Claude to assist with development, but all code is manually reviewed by me before merging.

## Release Schedule

We follow a predictable release cadence to balance new features with stability:

| When | What | Channel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sunday** | Integration testing and maintainer validation | Testing (`:develop`) |
| **Saturday** | New features and release candidates | Beta (`:beta`) |
| **Monthly** | Promote mature beta features to stable | Stable (`:latest`) |
| **As needed** | Critical hotfixes and urgent security patches | Stable (`:latest`) |

Releases are created manually, not on every commit. Track upcoming work on the [Release Schedule](https://github.com/users/Starosdev/projects/1) project board.

## Deployments

This repository also owns the testing and production deployment definitions for Scrutiny.

- Testing images publish from the `develop` branch through [`Deploy Testing Stack`](./.github/workflows/deploy-testing.yml)
- Beta images publish from the `beta` branch through [`Publish Beta Image`](./.github/workflows/deploy-beta.yml)
- Production deploys from the `master` branch through [`Automated Release and Deploy`](./.github/workflows/release-and-deploy.yml)
- `beta` is an optional pre-release channel for features that need validation before going to `master`
- Zeus production and testing are separate host appdata trees:
  - production: `/mnt/user/appdata/scrutiny`
  - testing: `/mnt/user/appdata/scrutiny-dev`
- Zeus host-side deploy helpers target the live appdata-root compose files, not the repo `deploy/*` example compose files:
  - production helper: `/mnt/user/appdata/scrutiny/docker-compose.yml`
  - testing helper: `/mnt/user/appdata/scrutiny-dev/docker-compose.yml`
- Host smoke checks require `/api/health` to return `200`, while the root path may legitimately redirect depending on auth or proxy behavior.
- Deployment compose files, env templates, and host expectations live in [docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md](./docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md)

## Loop pilot

This repo includes a loop pilot for PR flow, issue triage, and dependency hygiene.

- Control docs: [`LOOP.md`](./LOOP.md), [`STATE.md`](./STATE.md), [`loop-budget.md`](./loop-budget.md)
- Scheduled triage: [`.github/workflows/loop-pilot-triage.yaml`](./.github/workflows/loop-pilot-triage.yaml)
- Manual draft-only analyzers:
  - [`.github/workflows/loop-pilot-pr-babysitter.yaml`](./.github/workflows/loop-pilot-pr-babysitter.yaml)
  - [`.github/workflows/loop-pilot-dependency-sweeper.yaml`](./.github/workflows/loop-pilot-dependency-sweeper.yaml)

The pilot is intentionally draft-only for action loops: it can summarize blockers and produce artifacts, but it does not commit, push, merge, label, or comment on PRs.

# Introduction

If you run a server with more than a couple of hard drives, you're probably already familiar with S.M.A.R.T and the `smartd` daemon. If not, it's an incredible open source project described as the following:

> smartd is a daemon that monitors the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (SMART) system built into many ATA, IDE and SCSI-3 hard drives. The purpose of SMART is to monitor the reliability of the hard drive and predict drive failures, and to carry out different types of drive self-tests.

These S.M.A.R.T hard drive self-tests can help you detect and replace failing hard drives before they cause permanent data loss. However, there's a couple issues with `smartd`:

- There are more than a hundred S.M.A.R.T attributes, however `smartd` does not differentiate between critical and informational metrics
- `smartd` does not record S.M.A.R.T attribute history, so it can be hard to determine if an attribute is degrading slowly over time.
- S.M.A.R.T attribute thresholds are set by the manufacturer. In some cases these thresholds are unset, or are so high that they can only be used to confirm a failed drive, rather than detecting a drive about to fail.
- `smartd` is a command line only tool. For head-less servers a web UI would be more valuable.

**Scrutiny is a Hard Drive Health Dashboard & Monitoring solution, merging manufacturer provided S.M.A.R.T metrics with real-world failure rates.**

## API Documentation

The Scrutiny API is now documented from a canonical OpenAPI spec:

- OpenAPI: [docs/openapi.yaml](./docs/openapi.yaml)
- Swagger UI: [docs/swagger-ui.html](./docs/swagger-ui.html)
- Overview: [docs/API.md](./docs/API.md)
- Served Swagger UI: `/docs/api`
- Served OpenAPI spec: `/api/docs/openapi.yaml`
- Runtime auth default: docs/spec are auth-gated unless `web.docs.public=true`

If you change a route in `webapp/backend/pkg/web/server.go`, update `docs/openapi.yaml` in the same change.

# Migration from AnalogJ/scrutiny

If you're currently using the original AnalogJ/scrutiny, migrating is straightforward:

1. **Update your image reference** from `ghcr.io/analogj/scrutiny` to `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny`
2. **Data is compatible** - Your existing SQLite database and InfluxDB data will work without changes
3. **Config files are compatible** - No changes needed to `scrutiny.yaml` or `collector.yaml`

That's it! The fork maintains full backwards compatibility with the original project.

# Getting Started

## Optional: CodeGraph

If you want repo-local code navigation in this checkout, initialize CodeGraph from the repo root:

```bash
codegraph init .
```

The `.codegraph/` directory is local-only and gitignored. Create it separately in each worktree where you want the index. Once it exists, use `codegraph_explore` when the MCP tool is available or `codegraph explore "<symbol names or question>"` from the shell.

## RAID/Virtual Drives

Scrutiny uses `smartctl --scan` to detect devices/drives.

- All RAID controllers supported by `smartctl` are automatically supported by Scrutiny.
    - While some RAID controllers support passing through the underlying SMART data to `smartctl` others do not.
    - In some cases `--scan` does not correctly detect the device type, returning incomplete SMART data.
    Scrutiny supports overriding detected device type via the config file: see [example.collector.yaml](example.collector.yaml)
- If you use docker, you **must** pass though the RAID virtual disk to the container using `--device` (see below)
    - This device may be in `/dev/*` or `/dev/bus/*`.
    - If you're unsure, run `smartctl --scan` on your host, and pass all listed devices to the container.

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_DEVICE_COLLECTOR.md](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_DEVICE_COLLECTOR.md) for help

## Docker

If you're using Docker, getting started is as simple as running the following command:

In this fork, "local Docker testing" means the Zeus Unraid host, not this Mac.
Run containerized Scrutiny tests on Zeus over LAN `192.168.1.33` or NetBird
`100.66.106.240`, and treat the repo `deploy/*` files as examples unless a doc
explicitly points you at the live Zeus appdata compose files.

For a component-level overview of how Omnibus and Hub/Spoke fit together, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

> See [docker/example.omnibus.docker-compose.yml](docker/example.omnibus.docker-compose.yml) for a docker-compose file.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8086:8086 --restart unless-stopped \
  -v `pwd`/scrutiny:/opt/scrutiny/config \
  -v `pwd`/influxdb2:/opt/scrutiny/influxdb \
  -v /run/udev:/run/udev:ro \
  --cap-add SYS_RAWIO \
  --device=/dev/sda \
  --device=/dev/sdb \
  --name scrutiny \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-omnibus
```

- `/run/udev` is necessary to provide the Scrutiny collector with access to your device metadata
- `--cap-add SYS_RAWIO` is necessary to allow `smartctl` permission to query your device SMART data
    - NOTE: If you have **NVMe** drives, you must add `--cap-add SYS_ADMIN` as well.
- `--device` entries are required to ensure that your hard disk devices are accessible within the container.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-omnibus` is an omnibus image, containing both the webapp server (frontend & api) as well as the S.M.A.R.T metric collector. (see below)

### Hub/Spoke Deployment

In addition to the Omnibus image (available under the `latest` tag) you can deploy in Hub/Spoke mode using
the following Docker images:

- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector` - Contains the Scrutiny data collector, `smartctl` binary and cron-like
  scheduler. You can run one collector on each server.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-zfs` - ZFS pool collector for monitoring ZFS health.
  Run alongside or instead of the standard collector if you use ZFS. See [docs/ZFS_POOL_MONITORING.md](./docs/ZFS_POOL_MONITORING.md) for setup instructions.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-mdadm` - MDADM collector for Linux software RAID monitoring.
  See [docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md](./docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md) for setup instructions.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-btrfs` - Btrfs filesystem health collector.
  See [docs/BTRFS_FILESYSTEM_MONITORING.md](./docs/BTRFS_FILESYSTEM_MONITORING.md) for setup instructions.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-performance` - Performance benchmark collector using fio.
  Runs periodic benchmarks and tracks throughput, IOPS, and latency over time. See [Performance Benchmarking](#performance-benchmarking) for details.
- `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-web` - Contains the Web UI and API. Only one container necessary
- `influxdb:2.2` - InfluxDB image, used by the Web container to persist SMART data. Only one container necessary.
  See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_INFLUXDB.md](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_INFLUXDB.md)

Branch channel tags follow the same pattern across images:

- `develop-*` from the `develop` branch
- `beta-*` from the `beta` branch
- `latest-*` and semver tags from `master` and release tags

Default CI image publishing currently builds:

- `collector` for `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/arm/v7`
- `web`, `collector-zfs`, `collector-mdadm`, `collector-btrfs`, and `collector-performance` for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`

> See [docker/example.hubspoke.docker-compose.yml](docker/example.hubspoke.docker-compose.yml) for a docker-compose file.

```bash
docker run -p 8086:8086 --restart unless-stopped \
  -v `pwd`/influxdb2:/var/lib/influxdb2 \
  --name scrutiny-influxdb \
  influxdb:2.2

docker run -p 8080:8080 --restart unless-stopped \
  -v `pwd`/scrutiny:/opt/scrutiny/config \
  --name scrutiny-web \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-web

docker run --restart unless-stopped \
  -v /run/udev:/run/udev:ro \
  --cap-add SYS_RAWIO \
  --device=/dev/sda \
  --device=/dev/sdb \
  -e COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT=http://SCRUTINY_WEB_IPADDRESS:8080 \
  --name scrutiny-collector \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector
```

## Manual Installation (without-Docker)

While the easiest way to get started with Scrutiny is using Docker (see above),
it is possible to run it manually without much work. You can even mix and match, using Docker for one component and
a manual installation for the other.

See [docs/INSTALL_MANUAL.md](docs/INSTALL_MANUAL.md) for instructions.

## Usage

Once scrutiny is running, you can open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and take a look at the dashboard.

If you're using the omnibus image, the collector should already have run, and your dashboard should be populate with every
drive that Scrutiny detected. The collector is configured to run once a day, but you can trigger it manually by running the command below.

For users of the docker Hub/Spoke deployment or manual install: initially the dashboard will be empty.
After the first collector run, you'll be greeted with a list of all your hard drives and their current smart status.

```bash
docker exec scrutiny /opt/scrutiny/bin/scrutiny-collector-metrics run
```

# Configuration
By default Scrutiny looks for its YAML configuration files in `/opt/scrutiny/config`

There are four primary configuration files available:

- Webapp/API config via `scrutiny.yaml` - [example.scrutiny.yaml](example.scrutiny.yaml).
- Collector config via `collector.yaml` - [example.collector.yaml](example.collector.yaml).
- ZFS Collector config via `collector-zfs.yaml` - [example.collector-zfs.yaml](example.collector-zfs.yaml). See [docs/ZFS_POOL_MONITORING.md](./docs/ZFS_POOL_MONITORING.md) for setup instructions.
- Performance Collector config via `collector-performance.yaml` - [example.collector-performance.yaml](example.collector-performance.yaml). Falls back to `collector.yaml` if not found.

Additional dedicated collectors also have their own config surfaces:

- MDADM collector via `collector-mdadm.yaml` - see [docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md](./docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md)
- Btrfs collector via `collector-btrfs.yaml` - see [docs/BTRFS_FILESYSTEM_MONITORING.md](./docs/BTRFS_FILESYSTEM_MONITORING.md)
- Filesystem capacity collector uses its own binary and scheduling env vars - see [docs/FILESYSTEM_CAPACITY.md](./docs/FILESYSTEM_CAPACITY.md)

None of these files are required, however if provided, they allow you to configure how Scrutiny functions.

## Cron Schedule
Unfortunately the Cron schedule cannot be configured via the `collector.yaml` (as the collector binary needs to be triggered by a scheduler/cron).
However, if you are using the official `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector` or `ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-omnibus` docker images,
you can use the `COLLECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE` environmental variable to override the default cron schedule (daily @ midnight - `0 0 * * *`).

`docker run -e COLLECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE="0 0 * * *" ...`

## Prometheus Metrics

Scrutiny exposes a Prometheus metrics endpoint at `/api/metrics`. You can scrape this endpoint to integrate with Grafana or other monitoring tools.

Example Prometheus scrape config:
```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'scrutiny'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['scrutiny:8080']
    metrics_path: '/api/metrics'
```

If you have secured the metrics endpoint with `web.metrics.token` (see [Authentication](docs/AUTH.md#prometheus-metrics-authentication)):

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'scrutiny'
    metrics_path: '/api/metrics'
    bearer_token: 'your-metrics-token-here'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['scrutiny:8080']
```

## Home Assistant Integration (MQTT Discovery)

Scrutiny can natively integrate with Home Assistant via MQTT Discovery. When enabled, each drive automatically appears as a device in Home Assistant with sensors for temperature, health status, power-on hours, power cycle count, and a problem binary sensor.

This is a push-based integration -- state updates are published to MQTT whenever new S.M.A.R.T data is collected, so there's no polling delay. It uses the standard [HA MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery) protocol, so no custom components or HACS add-ons are needed.

### Requirements

- An MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto, EMQX) accessible from the Scrutiny web server
- Home Assistant with the MQTT integration configured and connected to the same broker

### Configuration

Add the following to your `scrutiny.yaml` (or use environment variables):

```yaml
web:
  mqtt:
    enabled: true
    broker: "tcp://localhost:1883"
    username: ""
    password: ""
    client_id: "scrutiny"
    topic_prefix: "homeassistant"
```

Or via environment variables in Docker:

```yaml
environment:
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_ENABLED: 'true'
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_BROKER: 'tcp://mosquitto:1883'
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_USERNAME: ''
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_PASSWORD: ''
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_CLIENT_ID: 'scrutiny'
  SCRUTINY_WEB_MQTT_TOPIC_PREFIX: 'homeassistant'
```

### Entities Per Drive

Each drive is registered as an HA device with the following entities:

| Entity | Type | Device Class | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|-------------|
| Temperature | `sensor` | `temperature` | Current drive temperature in Celsius |
| Health Status | `sensor` | -- | Passed / Failed (SMART) / Failed (Scrutiny) / Failed (Both) |
| Power On Hours | `sensor` | `duration` | Total hours the drive has been powered on |
| Power Cycle Count | `sensor` | -- | Number of power on/off cycles |
| Drive Problem | `binary_sensor` | `problem` | ON when the drive has any failure status |

### Device Naming

The HA device name follows this priority:
1. **Custom label** (if set via the Scrutiny UI) -- e.g., "Parity Drive"
2. **Model + device name** -- e.g., "ST4000DM000 (sda)"
3. **Model name only** -- e.g., "ST4000DM000"
4. **Device name only** -- e.g., "sda"
5. **WWN fallback** -- e.g., "Drive 0x5000cca264eb01d7"

Changing a device label in Scrutiny immediately updates the device name in Home Assistant.

### Behavior

- **Startup**: On startup, Scrutiny publishes discovery configs and current state for all active (non-archived) devices
- **SMART upload**: Each time a collector uploads new S.M.A.R.T data, the device state is published to MQTT
- **Device registration**: New devices are published to HA when first detected by a collector
- **Archiving**: Archiving a device removes it from HA; unarchiving restores it
- **Deletion**: Deleting a device removes it from HA
- **Availability**: Scrutiny publishes an LWT (Last Will and Testament) message so HA marks all entities as unavailable if the Scrutiny server goes offline

### Troubleshooting

See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md#mqtt--home-assistant) for MQTT troubleshooting tips.

## Performance Benchmarking

Scrutiny can run periodic [fio](https://fio.readthedocs.io/) benchmarks on your drives and track performance over time. This helps detect drive degradation before S.M.A.R.T failures appear -- a drive that is suddenly 50% slower may be failing even if S.M.A.R.T attributes look normal.

### What's Measured

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Sequential Read/Write | Throughput in bytes/sec (large block sequential I/O) |
| Random Read/Write IOPS | Input/output operations per second (4K random I/O) |
| Read/Write Latency | Average, P50, P95, P99 latency in nanoseconds |
| Mixed Read/Write IOPS | Combined random read+write performance |

### How It Works

1. The **performance collector** (`scrutiny-collector-performance`) runs fio benchmarks on configured devices
2. Results are uploaded to the Scrutiny API and stored as time-series data in InfluxDB
3. The **web UI** displays performance history charts and summary cards on the device detail page
4. A **baseline** is computed from the last 5 results, and current results are compared against it
5. **Degradation detection** flags warnings (>20% throughput drop or >30% latency increase) and failures (>40% / >60%)

### Deployment

The performance collector is available as a separate Docker image:

```bash
docker run --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_RAWIO \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --device=/dev/sda \
  --device=/dev/sdb \
  -e COLLECTOR_PERF_API_ENDPOINT=http://SCRUTINY_WEB_IPADDRESS:8080 \
  --name scrutiny-perf-collector \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-performance
```

The collector requires direct device access (not virtualized). Running benchmarks will temporarily increase I/O on the target drives, so schedule accordingly.

### Viewing Results

Performance data appears on the device detail page when benchmark results are available. The UI shows:

- **Summary cards** with latest values and baseline comparison badges
- **Throughput chart** -- sequential read/write bandwidth over time
- **IOPS chart** -- random read/write and mixed IOPS over time
- **Latency chart** -- read latency (average, P95, P99) over time

Use the duration selector to view day, week, month, or year ranges.

## Workload Insights

Scrutiny computes drive workload statistics from existing S.M.A.R.T attribute history. No additional collector configuration is required -- once at least two data points exist for a device, workload insights are available.

### What's Computed

| Metric | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Daily Writes / Reads | Average bytes written/read per day over the selected duration |
| R/W Ratio | Ratio of read to write volume (e.g., 2.0:1 means 2x more reads than writes) |
| Intensity | Workload classification: idle, light, medium, or heavy based on total daily I/O |
| SSD Endurance | SMART-reported wear percentage, plus optional rated-TBW usage when configured per device |
| Est. Remaining | Projected remaining lifespan in days/years based on current usage rate |
| Activity Spike | Alert when recent write activity exceeds 3x the baseline average |

### Computation Details

1. Scrutiny queries cumulative SMART counters (Total LBAs Written/Read for ATA, Data Units Written/Read for NVMe) from InfluxDB
2. The delta between the first and last data points in the selected time range is used to compute daily rates
3. Intensity is classified by total daily I/O: idle (<1 GB/day), light (1-20 GB), medium (20-100 GB), heavy (>100 GB)
4. SSD endurance is estimated from wear-leveling or percentage-used SMART attributes combined with power-on hours
5. If a rated TBW value is configured for a device, Scrutiny also shows cumulative TB written versus the configured limit
6. Spike detection compares the most recent daily rate against the long-term baseline

### Supported Protocols

- **ATA**: Uses SMART attributes 241/242 (Total LBAs Written/Read) or DeviceStats 1.24/1.40 (Logical Sectors Written/Read)
- **NVMe**: Uses Data Units Written/Read counters
- **SCSI**: Limited support (cumulative byte counters are not stored as SMART attributes)

### Viewing Workload Data

Navigate to the **Workload** page from the top navigation bar. Use the duration selector (Day, Week, Month, Year, All) to adjust the analysis window. Click any row to navigate to the device detail page.

### Rated TBW Overrides

Some SSDs report misleading wear percentages through SMART. To supplement those values, you can set a per-device rated TBW value from the device detail page. Scrutiny will then show:

- TB written so far
- Rated TBW
- TBW used percentage

This value is user-supplied and does not replace the existing SMART wear indicators.

## ATA SMART Self-Test History

Scrutiny now retains ATA SMART self-test log entries that are already present in uploaded `smartctl` payloads. On ATA drive detail pages, the web UI shows a **SMART Self-Tests** card with the recorded test type, pass/attention status, controller detail string, and power-on age.

- Data is read from normal SMART uploads; no separate self-test collector is required
- Only ATA devices show this section today
- Scrutiny keeps the most recent 21 recorded entries per physical ATA device identity
- The API route `GET /api/device/{id}/selftest` returns the same history used by the device detail page
- This feature records and displays history only; it does not trigger or schedule drive self-tests from the web UI

## SMART Attribute Overrides

Scrutiny allows you to customize how individual SMART attributes are evaluated. Use this to suppress false positives, ignore noisy attributes, force specific statuses, or set custom warning/failure thresholds.

### From the Device Detail Page (Quick Action)

1. Click on a drive to open its detail page
2. Find the attribute in the SMART table
3. Click the three-dot menu in the **Actions** column (appears on failed/warning attributes)
4. Select **Ignore attribute** to suppress it, or **Force passed** to override its status

These quick actions create device-specific overrides. To remove an override, click the purple tune icon and select **Remove override**.

### From Dashboard Settings (Global)

1. Open Dashboard Settings (gear icon)
2. Expand **SMART Attribute Overrides**
3. Fill in the override form:
   - **Protocol**: ATA, NVMe, or SCSI
   - **Attribute ID**: The attribute identifier (e.g., `199` for UltraDMA CRC Error Count, `media_errors` for NVMe)
   - **Action**: Ignore, Force Status, or Custom Threshold
   - **Device WWN** (optional): Leave empty to apply globally, or specify a WWN for a single device
4. Click **Add Override**

### From Config File

Add overrides to `scrutiny.yaml` under `smart.attribute_overrides`. See [example.scrutiny.yaml](example.scrutiny.yaml) for examples including ignore, force status, and custom threshold configurations.

### Override Types

| Action | Behavior |
| ------ | -------- |
| Ignore | Attribute marked as passed; excluded from device failure status and notifications |
| Force Status | Overrides computed status to passed, warn, or failed |
| Custom Threshold | Replaces default thresholds with user-defined warn_above/fail_above values |

Overrides apply at the next SMART data collection. Device status is recalculated immediately when overrides are added or removed via the UI.

## Consumer Drive Profiles

Scrutiny can apply vetted ATA consumer drive model or family overrides when evaluating SMART status and computing replacement risk. These profiles are intended to improve interpretation for common SATA HDD and SSD lines using validated thresholds informed by Backblaze failure data.

The feature is enabled by default and can be disabled globally in Dashboard Settings if you prefer generic ATA rules only. On ATA drive detail pages, Scrutiny also shows which evaluation path was used so the replacement-risk output is transparent:

- matched consumer drive profile family
- generic ATA rules because profiles were disabled
- generic ATA rules because no vetted profile matched the drive

For matching behavior, confidence thresholds, and API fields such as `consumer_drive_profiles_enabled` and `consumer_drive_profile_family`, see [docs/CONSUMER_DRIVE_PROFILES.md](./docs/CONSUMER_DRIVE_PROFILES.md).

## Notifications

Scrutiny supports multiple notification target types:

- Shoutrrr targets using the existing `discord://`, `smtp://`, `telegram://`, `gotify://`, and similar URL formats
- Apprise targets using an explicit `apprise+` prefix, for example `apprise+mailto://...`, `apprise+gotify://...`, or `apprise+https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...`
- Custom `script://` targets that execute a local script with notification metadata in environment variables
- Raw `http://` and `https://` webhook targets

This keeps existing Shoutrrr configuration backward compatible while adding Apprise as a second notification engine. If you want Scrutiny to route a target through Apprise, the `apprise+` prefix is required.

Common examples:

- `discord://token@webhookid`
- `gotify://gotify-host/token`
- `script:///file/path/on/disk`
- `https://www.example.com/path`
- `apprise+mailto://example.com?user=alerts@example.com&pass=app-password&to=admin@example.com`
- `apprise+gotify://gotify-host/token`
- `apprise+tgram://123456789:ABCDEF/123456789/`

Check the `notify.urls` section of [example.scrutiny.yaml](example.scrutiny.yaml) for more examples.

For more information and troubleshooting, see the [TROUBLESHOOTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md](./docs/TROUBLESHOOTING_NOTIFICATIONS.md) file

### Heartbeat Notifications

Scrutiny can send periodic "all clear" heartbeat notifications to confirm the monitoring system is running and all drives are healthy. This is useful for integration with uptime monitoring tools like Uptime Kuma. When delivered through SMTP or HTML-capable Apprise targets, heartbeat messages use the same HTML-plus-plain-text pattern as the other email notifications.

- **Disabled by default** -- enable via Settings in the web UI or the `/api/settings` API
- **Configurable interval** -- defaults to every 24 hours
- **Suppressed during failures** -- heartbeat is not sent if any drive has active failures (failure notifications take priority)

### Per-Device Notification Control

You can mute notifications for specific devices through the web UI. This is useful for drives that are known to have issues but are being monitored before replacement.

### Scheduled Reports [WIP]

Scrutiny can generate and email periodic health reports summarizing device status, temperature, alerts, and ZFS pool health. Reports are sent via your configured notification URLs. SMTP deliveries use multipart email with separate HTML and plain-text bodies. HTML-capable Apprise targets receive the HTML body when supported by the destination, while plain-text-only targets receive the text body.

> **Note:** This feature is a work in progress. It is functional and tested, but the UI and report content may change based on feedback. We'd appreciate hearing about your experience -- please open an issue with suggestions or bug reports.

**Configuration** is done via the Settings page in the web UI, or via the `/api/settings` API:

| Setting | Key | Default | Description |
| ------- | --- | ------- | ----------- |
| Enable reports | `metrics.report_enabled` | `false` | Master toggle for scheduled reports |
| Daily reports | `metrics.report_daily_enabled` | `false` | Enable daily report |
| Daily time | `metrics.report_daily_time` | `"03:00"` | Time to send daily report (24h format) |
| Weekly reports | `metrics.report_weekly_enabled` | `false` | Enable weekly report |
| Weekly day | `metrics.report_weekly_day` | `1` | Day of week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday) |
| Weekly time | `metrics.report_weekly_time` | `"03:00"` | Time to send weekly report |
| Monthly reports | `metrics.report_monthly_enabled` | `false` | Enable monthly report |
| Monthly day | `metrics.report_monthly_day` | `1` | Day of month (1-28) |
| Monthly time | `metrics.report_monthly_time` | `"03:00"` | Time to send monthly report |
| PDF export | `metrics.report_pdf_enabled` | `false` | Also save reports as PDF files |
| PDF path | `metrics.report_pdf_path` | `"/opt/scrutiny/reports"` | Directory for PDF files |

**Example API call to enable daily reports:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/settings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"metrics": {"report_enabled": true, "report_daily_enabled": true, "report_daily_time": "07:00"}}'
```

**On-demand report generation:**

```bash
# Generate and send a report immediately
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/reports/generate?period=daily&test=true'

# Generate a PDF report
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/reports/generate?period=daily&format=pdf'
```

**Report content includes:**

- Overall health status (passed/warning/failed) with color-coded banner
- Summary counts (total, passed, warning, failed devices)
- Failure and warning details per device
- Device table with status, temperature, power-on hours, and alert counts
- Temperature summary (hottest/coldest devices)
- ZFS pool health (if applicable)

### Missed Ping Digest

When multiple collectors miss their expected check-in within the configured timeout, Scrutiny sends a single consolidated notification listing all affected devices, instead of flooding your inbox with one email per device.

### Testing Notifications

You can test that your notifications are configured correctly by posting an empty payload to the notifications health check API.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/health/notify
```

The test route sends through the same configured targets as normal notifications, including Shoutrrr, explicit `apprise+...` targets, scripts, and raw webhooks.

# Debug mode & Log Files
Scrutiny provides various methods to change the log level and generate log files.
The web server and collector have **independent** log configurations and can be set separately.

## Valid Log Levels

The following log levels are supported (case-insensitive), listed from highest to lowest severity:

| Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PANIC` | Calls panic after logging |
| `FATAL` | Calls os.Exit(1) after logging |
| `ERROR` | Error conditions |
| `WARN` | Warning conditions (also accepts `WARNING`) |
| `INFO` | General operational messages **(default)** |
| `DEBUG` | Verbose diagnostic information |
| `TRACE` | Very fine-grained diagnostic information |

Setting a level includes all messages at that level **and above** (higher severity).
For example, setting `WARN` will show WARN, ERROR, FATAL, and PANIC messages, but not INFO, DEBUG, or TRACE.

## Web Server/API

You can use environmental variables to enable debug logging and/or log files for the web server:

```bash
DEBUG=true
SCRUTINY_LOG_FILE=/tmp/web.log
```

You can configure the log level and log file in the config file:

```yml
log:
  file: '/tmp/web.log'
  level: DEBUG
```

Or if you're not using docker, you can pass CLI arguments to the web server during startup:

```bash
scrutiny start --debug --log-file /tmp/web.log
```

### Web Server Environment Variable Overrides

Any web server configuration key can be overridden via environment variables using the `SCRUTINY_` prefix.
Dots and dashes in key names become underscores.

| Config Key | Environment Variable | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `failures.ignored.nvme` | `SCRUTINY_FAILURES_IGNORED_NVME` | `[]` |
| `failures.ignored.scsi` | `SCRUTINY_FAILURES_IGNORED_SCSI` | `[]` |

Environment variables take precedence over config file values. This is useful for containerized
deployments where you want to override specific settings without modifying the config file.

Example:

```bash
docker run -e SCRUTINY_WEB_LISTEN_PORT=9090 \
  -e SCRUTINY_WEB_INFLUXDB_HOST=influxdb.local \
  -e SCRUTINY_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-web
```

## Collector

You can use environmental variables to enable debug logging and/or log files for the collector:

```bash
DEBUG=true
COLLECTOR_LOG_FILE=/tmp/collector.log
```

Or if you're not using docker, you can pass CLI arguments to the collector during startup:

```bash
scrutiny-collector-metrics run --debug --log-file /tmp/collector.log
```

### Collector Environment Variable Overrides

Any collector configuration key can be overridden via environment variables using the `COLLECTOR_` prefix.
Dots and dashes in key names become underscores.

| Config Key | Environment Variable | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host.id` | `COLLECTOR_HOST_ID` | `` |
| `api.endpoint` | `COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `api.timeout` | `COLLECTOR_API_TIMEOUT` | `60` |
| `api.token` | `COLLECTOR_API_TOKEN` | `` |
| `commands.metrics_smartctl_bin` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_SMARTCTL_BIN` | `smartctl` |
| `commands.metrics_scan_args` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_SCAN_ARGS` | `--scan --json` |
| `commands.metrics_info_args` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_INFO_ARGS` | `--info --json` |
| `commands.metrics_smart_args` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_SMART_ARGS` | `--xall --json` |
| `commands.metrics_smartctl_wait` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_SMARTCTL_WAIT` | `0` |
| `allow_listed_devices` | `COLLECTOR_ALLOW_LISTED_DEVICES` | `[]` |
| `log.level` | `COLLECTOR_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` |
| `log.file` | `COLLECTOR_LOG_FILE` | `` |

Environment variables take precedence over config file values. This is useful for containerized
deployments where you want to override specific settings without modifying the config file.

Example:

```bash
docker run -e COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_SMART_ARGS="--xall --json -T permissive" \
  -e COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT=http://scrutiny-web:8080 \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector
```

### Docker-Only Environment Variables

These environment variables are only available when running the collector in Docker containers (handled by the entrypoint script, not Viper configuration):

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLLECTOR_CRON_SCHEDULE` | `0 0 * * *` | Cron schedule for SMART data collection |
| `COLLECTOR_RUN_STARTUP` | `false` | Run collector immediately on container start |
| `COLLECTOR_RUN_STARTUP_SLEEP` | `1` | Delay in seconds before startup collection |

## Performance Collector

The performance collector is a separate binary (`scrutiny-collector-performance`) that runs fio benchmarks. It can use its own config file (`collector-performance.yaml`) or fall back to the main `collector.yaml`.

```bash
DEBUG=true
COLLECTOR_PERF_LOG_FILE=/tmp/performance.log
```

Or via CLI:

```bash
scrutiny-collector-performance run --debug --log-file /tmp/performance.log --profile quick
```

### Performance Collector Environment Variable Overrides

The performance collector checks `COLLECTOR_PERF_` prefixed variables first, then falls back to `COLLECTOR_` prefixed variables.

| Config Key | Environment Variable | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host.id` | `COLLECTOR_PERF_HOST_ID` or `COLLECTOR_HOST_ID` | `` |
| `api.endpoint` | `COLLECTOR_PERF_API_ENDPOINT` or `COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT` | `http://localhost:8080` |
| `performance.profile` | `COLLECTOR_PERF_PROFILE` | `quick` |
| `performance.enabled` | `COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE_ENABLED` | `false` |
| `performance.allow_direct_device_io` | `COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE_ALLOW_DIRECT_DEVICE_IO` | `false` |
| `performance.temp_file_size` | `COLLECTOR_PERFORMANCE_TEMP_FILE_SIZE` | `256M` |
| `commands.performance_fio_bin` | `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_PERFORMANCE_FIO_BIN` | `fio` |
| `log.level` | `COLLECTOR_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` |
| `log.file` | `COLLECTOR_PERF_LOG_FILE` or `COLLECTOR_LOG_FILE` | `` |

### Performance Collector Docker-Only Environment Variables

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLLECTOR_PERF_CRON_SCHEDULE` | `0 2 * * 0` | Cron schedule (default: Sunday 2 AM) |
| `COLLECTOR_PERF_RUN_STARTUP` | `false` | Run benchmark immediately on container start |
| `COLLECTOR_PERF_RUN_STARTUP_SLEEP` | `1` | Delay in seconds before startup run |

Example:

```bash
docker run --restart unless-stopped \
  --cap-add SYS_RAWIO \
  --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
  --device=/dev/sda \
  --device=/dev/sdb \
  -e COLLECTOR_PERF_API_ENDPOINT=http://scrutiny-web:8080 \
  -e COLLECTOR_PERF_PROFILE=quick \
  -e COLLECTOR_PERF_CRON_SCHEDULE="0 2 * * 0" \
  ghcr.io/starosdev/scrutiny:latest-collector-performance
```

## MDADM Collector

MDADM RAID monitoring is handled by a separate binary, `scrutiny-collector-mdadm`. It is not part of the SMART metrics collector or the fio performance collector.

The MDADM collector prefers its own config file, `collector-mdadm.yaml`, and falls back to `collector.yaml` if that file is not present.

### MDADM Collector Environment Variable Overrides

| Setting | Preferred Environment Variable | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API endpoint | `COLLECTOR_MDADM_API_ENDPOINT` | `COLLECTOR_API_ENDPOINT` |
| API token | `COLLECTOR_MDADM_API_TOKEN` | `COLLECTOR_API_TOKEN` |
| Log file | `COLLECTOR_MDADM_LOG_FILE` | `COLLECTOR_LOG_FILE` |
| Debug logging | `COLLECTOR_MDADM_DEBUG` | `COLLECTOR_DEBUG` or `DEBUG` |

### MDADM Collector Docker-Only Scheduling Variables

| Environment Variable | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `COLLECTOR_MDADM_CRON_SCHEDULE` | `*/15 * * * *` | Cron schedule for MDADM collection |
| `COLLECTOR_MDADM_RUN_STARTUP` | `false` | Run collection immediately on container start |
| `COLLECTOR_MDADM_RUN_STARTUP_SLEEP` | `1` | Delay in seconds before the startup run |

For mounts, capabilities, compose examples, and troubleshooting, see [docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md](docs/MDADM_MONITORING.md).
